# Unused Code Analysis

This report details potentially unused code found within the project. The analysis is performed in two parts:
1.  **Unused Local Variables & Imports:** Based on ESLint's `no-unused-vars` rule. These are items defined but not used within the same file.
2.  **Potentially Unused Exports:** Based on a deeper analysis of exported functions, classes, and components that do not appear to be imported or used in other parts of the codebase.

**Disclaimer:** Static analysis cannot always detect dynamically used code. Please review each item carefully before removal.
