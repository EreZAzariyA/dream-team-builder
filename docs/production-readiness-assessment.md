## üö® Critical Blockers (P0) - Production Stoppers

### 1. Zero Test Coverage
**Risk Level**: üî¥ **CRITICAL**

```
‚ùå No automated tests whatsoever
‚ùå No integration tests for agent orchestration  
‚ùå No E2E tests for complex workflows
‚ùå No unit tests for core business logic
```

**Impact**: In a system coordinating 10+ AI agents with complex state transitions, untested code will fail catastrophically in production. One bad agent output could cascade through the entire workflow, leaving users with broken projects and no recovery path.

**Evidence**: No `tests/` directory, no test commands in `package.json`, manual testing only.

**Immediate Action Required**:
- [ ] Integration tests for core BMAD workflow paths
- [ ] Unit tests for `WorkflowEngine.js` and `AgentCommunicator.js`
- [ ] E2E tests for complete user workflows

---

### 2. Agent Orchestration Reliability Gaps
**Risk Level**: üî¥ **CRITICAL**

```
‚ùå No workflow rollback/checkpoint system
‚ùå No agent timeout handling  
‚ùå No graceful failure recovery
‚ùå No concurrent workflow limits
‚ùå No agent output validation
```

**Impact**: Agents can get stuck indefinitely, leaving users with broken workflows and no recovery path. System could consume unlimited resources with runaway processes.

**Critical Questions**:
- What happens when the Developer agent produces invalid code?
- How do you handle PM agent timeouts?
- Where are the workflow checkpoints for recovery?

**Architecture Gap**: `WorkflowEngine.js` lacks rollback mechanisms and failure recovery strategies.

**Immediate Action Required**:
- [ ] Implement agent execution timeouts
- [ ] Add workflow checkpoint/rollback system
- [ ] Create graceful degradation for agent failures
- [ ] Add concurrent workflow throttling

---

### 3. AI Service Dependency Risk
**Risk Level**: üî¥ **CRITICAL**

```
‚ùå Single point of failure on Google Gemini
‚ùå No circuit breakers or retry policies
‚ùå Basic fallback responses inadequate for complex workflows
‚ùå No cost controls or usage limits
```

**Impact**: When Gemini experiences downtime (which it will), your entire platform becomes unusable. No fallback AI provider configured.

**Financial Risk**: No per-user API usage limits could result in unexpected costs.

**Evidence**: `AIService.js` has basic fallback but insufficient for production workflows.

**Immediate Action Required**:
- [ ] Implement circuit breaker pattern for AI calls
- [ ] Add secondary AI provider (OpenAI, Anthropic)
- [ ] Create intelligent retry policies
- [ ] Implement per-user usage limits

---

‚ùå No rate limiting on expensive AI operations
‚ùå No input sanitization for agent-generated content
‚ùå Potential API key exposure in client-side code
‚ùå No CSRF protection visible
```

**Security Concerns**:
- Long-lived JWTs increase compromise risk
- Unvalidated agent outputs could inject malicious content
- Missing rate limiting on AI endpoints

**Immediate Action Required**:
- [ ] Reduce JWT expiry to 24 hours with refresh tokens
- [ ] Add comprehensive input validation for agent outputs
- [ ] Implement rate limiting on `/api/bmad/*` endpoints
- [ ] Security audit of client-side API key usage

‚ùå No backup strategy for MongoDB
‚ùå No data retention/cleanup policies
‚ùå Session storage in memory (won't survive restarts)
‚ùå No database migration strategy
```

**Scaling Risk**: File system storage will fail under load and won't work in containerized environments.

**Data Loss Risk**: No backup strategy means potential total data loss.

**Immediate Action Required**:
- [ ] Migrate artifact storage to cloud storage (S3, Azure Blob)
- [ ] Implement MongoDB backup strategy
- [ ] Create data retention and cleanup policies
- [ ] Add database migration system

---

### 6. Real-time Communication Scaling
**Risk Level**: üü† **HIGH**

```
‚ùå Pusher limits not addressed for concurrent users
‚ùå No WebSocket fallback mechanisms
‚ùå Message queuing for offline users missing
‚ùå No connection pooling strategy
```

**Scaling Risk**: Pusher has connection limits that could be exceeded during peak usage.

**UX Risk**: Users lose real-time updates when connections fail.

**Immediate Action Required**:
- [ ] Implement WebSocket fallback for Pusher failures
- [ ] Add message queuing for offline users
- [ ] Plan for Pusher scaling limits
- [ ] Implement connection retry logic

## Current Test Coverage Analysis

This section provides a detailed overview of the existing automated tests within the `tests/` directory, based on a recent analysis. This updates the "Zero Test Coverage" assessment in the main document.

### Test Types and Locations:

*   **Unit Tests:**
    *   `tests/unit/basic.test.js`: Verifies basic Jest functionality and assertions.
    *   `tests/unit/simple.test.js`: Confirms Jest setup, global utilities, console mocks, and fake timers are working correctly.
    *   `tests/unit/lib/bmad/AgentCommunicator.test.js`: Focuses on the `AgentCommunicator` class, testing message sending, handling, history, and mocked WebSocket integration.
    *   `tests/unit/lib/bmad/AgentCommunicator-real.test.js`: Provides more in-depth unit tests for `AgentCommunicator`, including message validation, event emission, and active channel tracking, with real dependencies where appropriate.

*   **Integration Tests:**
    *   `tests/api/bmad/workflow.test.js`: Comprehensive API integration tests for the `/api/bmad/workflow` and `/api/bmad/workflow/[id]` endpoints, covering CRUD operations and various error scenarios.
    *   `tests/integration/mongodb.test.js`: Tests the in-memory MongoDB setup and fundamental Mongoose operations. **(Currently skipped in test runs)**
    *   `tests/integration/workflow-engine.test.js`: Integrations tests for the `WorkflowEngine`, covering workflow lifecycle, agent orchestration, artifact management, and analytics. **(Currently skipped in test runs)**
    *   `tests/integration/bmad-orchestration.test.js`: High-level integration tests for the `BmadOrchestrator`, including workflow initialization, execution, inter-agent communication, and error handling. **(Currently skipped in test runs)**
    *   `tests/integration/bmad-orchestration-real.test.js`: End-to-end integration tests for the core BMAD system components, utilizing mocked external interactions. **(Currently skipped in test runs)**

### Test Setup and Mocks:

*   `tests/api.setup.js`: Sets up an in-memory MongoDB and provides global `apiTestUtils` for API integration tests.
*   `tests/integration.setup.js`: Provides global setup for general integration tests, including in-memory MongoDB and `integrationTestUtils`.
*   `tests/env.setup.js`: Configures mock environment variables for all tests.
*   `tests/setup.js`: Global Jest setup, including DOM matchers, console mocks, fake timers, and global `testUtils`.
*   `tests/__mocks__/ai-service.js`: Mocks the AI service for isolated testing of AI-dependent components.
*   `tests/__mocks__/pusher.js`: Mocks the Pusher real-time service for testing real-time features without external dependencies.
*   `tests/__mocks__/fileMock.js`: Mocks static file imports to prevent issues with non-JavaScript assets.

### Key Observations and Discrepancies with Original Assessment:

*   **Automated Tests Exist:** Contrary to the original assessment, a substantial number of automated unit and integration tests are present in the `tests/` directory.
*   **Agent Orchestration Coverage:** There are dedicated integration tests (`workflow-engine.test.js`, `bmad-orchestration.test.js`, `bmad-orchestration-real.test.js`) specifically for agent orchestration, which was previously marked as missing.
*   **Unit Tests for Core Logic:** `AgentCommunicator.test.js` and `AgentCommunicator-real.test.js` provide unit test coverage for a critical BMAD component.
*   **Critical Gap: Skipped Tests:** A major concern is that several key integration test suites (`mongodb.test.js`, `workflow-engine.test.js`, `bmad-orchestration.test.js`, `bmad-orchestration-real.test.js`) are currently **skipped** in the test runner configuration (indicated by `describe.skip`). This means they are not being executed during regular test runs, effectively masking their coverage and potential failures.
*   **E2E Tests Still Missing:** A search for `.e2e.js` files did not yield any results, confirming that comprehensive end-to-end user flow tests that interact with the UI are still absent.
*   **Comprehensive Unit Test Coverage:** While some core logic is unit-tested, the extent of unit test coverage across the entire `lib/` directory for all core business logic remains to be fully assessed.

### Recommendation:

The immediate priority for improving test coverage and overall production readiness is to **enable and fix all currently skipped integration test suites**. These tests cover critical aspects of the BMAD system and their active execution is essential for ensuring stability and catching regressions. Following this, efforts should focus on implementing E2E tests and expanding unit test coverage for other core modules.

  state: {
    artifacts: [mongoose.Schema.Types.Mixed],
    messages: [mongoose.Schema.Types.Mixed],
    errors: [mongoose.Schema.Types.Mixed],
    context: mongoose.Schema.Types.Mixed,
    metadata: mongoose.Schema.Types.Mixed
  },
  expiresAt: { type: Date, index: { expireAfterSeconds: 0 } }
});

// API endpoints for rollback control
PUT /api/bmad/workflow { action: "rollback", checkpointId: "..." }
PUT /api/bmad/workflow { action: "resume_rollback" }
```

**Production Benefits:**
- **Failure recovery** - Users never lose hours of workflow progress
