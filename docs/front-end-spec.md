## User Flows

#### User Registration

**User Goal:** To successfully create a new account and gain access to the application.

**Entry Points:** Homepage (via "Register" button/link).

**Success Criteria:** User account created, user logged in, and redirected to the dashboard.

**Flow Diagram:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start: Homepage] --> B{Click Register};
    B --> C[Registration Form];
    C --> D{Enter Valid Email, First Name, Last Name & Strong Password};
    D --> E{Submit Form};
    E --> F{Account Created Successfully};
    F --> G[Redirect to Dashboard];
    G --> H[End: Logged In];

    D -- Invalid Email Format --> I[Display Error: Invalid Email];
    D -- Weak Password --> J[Display Error: Password Too Weak];
    D -- Email Already Exists --> K[Display Error: Email Already Registered];
    D -- Missing Required Fields --> L[Display Error: All Fields Required];
    I --> C;
    J --> C;
    K --> C;
    L --> C;
```

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- Invalid email format: Display inline error message.
- Password not meeting strength requirements: Display inline error message.
- Email already registered: Display inline error message.
- Missing required fields (First Name, Last Name, Email, Password): Display inline error message.
- Network error during submission: Display generic error message and allow retry.

**Notes:**
- Password confirmation field is assumed to be part of the "Enter Valid Email & Strong Password" step.
- Success leads directly to login and dashboard access.
- First Name and Last Name fields are required for a complete user profile.

#### User Login

**User Goal:** To securely access a personalized workspace as a registered user.

**Entry Points:** Homepage (via "Login" button/link), or after successful registration.

**Success Criteria:** User successfully logged in and redirected to the personalized dashboard.

**Flow Diagram:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start: Homepage/Registration Success] --> B{Click Login};
    B --> C[Login Form];
    C --> D{Choose Login Method};

    D -- Email/Password --> E[Enter Email & Password];
    E --> F{Submit Form};
    F --> G{Credentials Validated};
    G --> H[Redirect to Dashboard];
    H --> I[End: Logged In];

    D -- Google Login --> J{Click "Sign in with Google"};
    J --> K{Google Authentication};
    K -- Success --> G;
    K -- Failure/Cancel --> L[Display Error: Google Auth Failed];
    L --> C;

    F -- Invalid Credentials --> M[Display Error: Invalid Email or Password];
    M --> C;
```

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- Invalid email/password: Display inline error message.
- Google authentication failure/cancellation: Display appropriate error message.
- Network error during submission: Display generic error message and allow retry.
- Session persistence: User remains logged in across browser sessions (handled implicitly by successful login).

**Notes:**
- The login form will provide options for both email/password and Google login.
- Successful login for either method leads to the dashboard.

#### User Dashboard Access

**User Goal:** To view an overview of personal activities and access key features after logging in.

**Entry Points:** After successful login, or direct navigation to the dashboard URL while authenticated.

**Success Criteria:** User successfully lands on and interacts with their personalized dashboard.

**Flow Diagram:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start: Successful Login] --> B[Redirect to Dashboard];
    B --> C[Dashboard Page Loaded];
    C --> D{View Overview of Activities};
    C --> E{Access Key Features};
    C --> F{Navigate to Settings/Profile};
    C --> G{Navigate to Project/Repository Management};
    C --> H[End: User Interacting with Dashboard];

    B -- Session Expired/Invalid --> I[Redirect to Login Page];
```

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- Session expired or invalid: User is redirected to the login page.
- Network issues preventing data load: Display a loading indicator or error message for dashboard content.
- Unauthorized access attempt: Redirect to login page with an appropriate message.

**Notes:**
- The dashboard will serve as the central hub for authenticated users.
- "Key Features" will include links or widgets related to BMAD agent integration and workflow visualization.

#### Access Standard Information Pages

**User Goal:** To understand the application's terms and purpose by accessing standard information pages.

**Entry Points:** Links in the application's footer or other designated areas (accessible only when logged in, as per the updated IA).

**Success Criteria:** User successfully navigates to and views the content of the Privacy Policy or About Us page.

**Flow Diagram:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start: Any Authenticated Page] --> B{Click "Privacy Policy" Link};
    B --> C[Privacy Policy Page Loaded];
    C --> D[End: Viewing Privacy Policy];

    A --> E{Click "About Us" Link};
    E --> F[About Us Page Loaded];
    F --> G[End: Viewing About Us];
```

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- Page not found (404): Display a generic error page.
- Network issues preventing content load: Display a loading indicator or error message.

**Notes:**
- These pages are static content and do not require complex interactions.
- Access to these pages is restricted to logged-in users, as per the updated Information Architecture.

#### Initiate BMAD Workflow via User Prompt

**User Goal:** To start an automated BMAD workflow by providing initial input.

**Entry Points:** User Dashboard (main input prompt).

**Success Criteria:** The BMAD-METHOD workflow is initiated, and the first agent in the sequence begins execution.

**Flow Diagram:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start: User Dashboard] --> B{Prompt Input Empty};
    B -- Yes --> C[Submit Button Disabled];
    B -- No --> D[Submit Button Enabled];

    D --> E{User Enters Text in Prompt};
    E --> F[Submit Button Enabled];
    F --> G{User Clicks Submit};
    G --> H[Prompt Input Becomes Read-Only];
    G --> I[Submit Button Becomes Disabled];
    G --> J[System Initiates BMAD-METHOD Workflow];
    J --> K[System Activates First Agent in Sequence];
    K --> L[End: Workflow Initiated, Agent Executing];
```

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- Prompt input empty: Submit button remains disabled.
- User attempts to edit prompt after submission: Input field is read-only, preventing modification.
- User attempts multiple submissions: Submit button is disabled after the first click, preventing redundant triggers.
- System error during initiation: Display a generic error message to the user.

**Notes:**
- This flow focuses on the initiation trigger and user interaction controls.
- The "text" entered by the user will serve as the initial input for the BMAD workflow.
- The visualization of progress is handled in Epic 3.

#### Load and Manage BMAD Agent Definitions

**System Goal:** To correctly load and manage the definitions of BMAD agents and their dependencies, so that agents can execute their tasks and workflows as intended.

**Entry Points:** BMAD-METHOD Workflow Initiation (triggered by Story 2.1).

**Success Criteria:** All necessary agent definitions and their dependencies are successfully loaded and ready for execution.

**Flow Diagram:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start: Workflow Initiated] --> B{Access BMAD Agent Definitions};
    B --> C[Parse Agent YAML Definitions];
    C --> D{Identify Required Dependencies};
    D --> E[Load Dependencies (Tasks, Templates, Checklists, Data)];
    E --> F{Verify Resource Availability};
    F --> G{Adhere to Agent Activation Instructions/Core Principles};
    G --> H[End: Agent Definitions Loaded & Managed];

    F -- Resource Not Found --> I[Log Error: Missing Resource];
    I --> H;
    C -- Parsing Error --> J[Log Error: Invalid Agent Definition];
    J --> H;
```

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- Missing or invalid agent YAML definitions: Log an error and potentially halt the workflow or skip the affected agent.
- Missing required dependencies (task files, templates, etc.): Log an error and prevent the agent from executing its task.
- Failure to adhere to activation instructions/core principles: This is an internal system failure that should be logged and potentially trigger a workflow halt.

**Notes:**
- This flow is primarily internal to the system and does not involve direct user interaction.
- Successful completion of this flow ensures the operational readiness of the BMAD agents for sequential execution.
- The successful loading and management of these definitions (as per this flow) is crucial for enabling the sequential triggering of agents upon task completion, as described in Story 2.1.

#### Visualize Active Agent and Inter-Agent Communication

**User Goal:** To visually track the active BMAD agent and see the communication between agents, so that I can understand the workflow's progress and internal operations.

**Entry Points:** BMAD Workflow Running (after initiation from Epic 2).

**Success Criteria:** The active agent is clearly highlighted, its status is updated, and inter-agent messages are displayed in a chat panel.

**Flow Diagram:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start: Workflow Running] --> B{Agent Becomes Active};
    B --> C[UI: Highlight Agent Border];
    B --> D[UI: Set Agent Status to "Active"];
    D --> E{Agent Completes Task};
    E --> F[UI: Set Agent Status to "Idle"];
    F --> G[End: Agent Visuals Updated];

    A --> H{Agent Sends Message to Another Agent};
    H --> I[System: Capture Inter-Agent Message];
    I --> J[UI: Display Message in Chat Panel];
    J --> K[End: Message Displayed];
```

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- UI rendering issues: Ensure robust UI components that can handle rapid status updates and message streams.
- High volume of messages: Implement scrolling, message limits, or filtering in the chat panel to maintain usability.
- Agent failure: The agent's status should reflect an error state, and relevant error messages should be displayed in the chat panel.

**Notes:**
- The "chat panel" is a dedicated area in the UI for displaying inter-agent communication.
- The visual highlighting and status updates should be near real-time to provide immediate feedback to the user.

#### Display Overall Workflow Status and Progress

**User Goal:** To see the overall status of the BMAD workflow and which step is currently being executed, so that I can understand the high-level progress of the automated process.

**Entry Points:** BMAD Workflow Running (after initiation from Epic 2).

**Success Criteria:** A clear indicator of the overall workflow status is displayed, and the current step/phase is updated automatically.

**Flow Diagram:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start: Workflow Initiated] --> B{System Determines Overall Workflow Status};
    B --> C[UI: Display Overall Status (e.g., "Running", "Paused", "Completed", "Error")];
    C --> D{System Identifies Current Workflow Step/Phase};
    D --> E[UI: Display Current Step/Phase (e.g., "Analyst Phase", "PM Phase")];

    E --> F{Workflow Progresses to Next Step};
    F --> D;

    C -- Workflow Completes --> G[UI: Set Status to "Completed"];
    C -- Error Occurs --> H[UI: Set Status to "Error" & Display Message];
```

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- System fails to determine status: Display a "Status Unknown" or similar message.
- Rapid phase changes: Ensure the UI updates smoothly without flickering.
- Unhandled errors: The system should gracefully transition to an "Error" state and provide a user-friendly message.

**Notes:**
- This visualization complements the detailed agent-level view from Story 3.1.
- The "current step/phase" could be derived from the active agent's role or the specific task being executed.

#### Display Agent-Generated Output/Artifacts

**User Goal:** To see the documents, code, or other artifacts generated by the BMAD agents during the workflow, so that I can review the tangible results of the automated process.

**Entry Points:** BMAD Workflow Running (as agents complete tasks).

**Success Criteria:** Generated outputs are displayed in a dedicated panel, organized, and accessible for review or download.

**Flow Diagram:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start: Agent Completes Task] --> B{Agent Generates Output/Artifact};
    B --> C{System Identifies Output Type};

    C -- Document (e.g., PRD, Story) --> D[UI: Display Document in Dedicated Panel/Link];
    C -- Code/Config File --> E[UI: Display Code with Syntax Highlighting/Link for Download];
    C -- Log/Report --> F[UI: Display Log/Report in Clear Format];

    D --> G[End: Output Displayed];
    E --> G;
    F --> G;

    G --> H{Multiple Outputs Generated};
    H --> I[UI: Organize Outputs Chronologically/by Agent];
    I --> J[End: All Outputs Organized];

    G --> K{Output is a File};
    K --> L[UI: Provide Download/View Option];
    L --> M[End: File Accessible];
```

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- Large files: Implement pagination or lazy loading for large documents/logs to prevent performance issues.
- Unsupported file types: Display a message indicating the file type is not supported for direct viewing, but provide a download option.
- Corrupted output: Display an error message and indicate the output is corrupted.
- Failure to save output: Log an error and notify the user if an expected output is missing.

**Notes:**
- The "dedicated output panel" should be a prominent area in the UI.
- Organization of outputs is crucial for user review, especially in longer workflows.

*   **Line Height:** Comfortable spacing with a line-height of around 1.4 for readability.

#### Iconography
*   **Icon Library:** Prefer free icon libraries like FontAwesome, Feather Icons, or Heroicons.
*   **Usage Guidelines:** Simple and clear line-style icons to match the clean aesthetic. Use commonly recognized icons for frequent actions (settings, search, submit, etc.).

#### Spacing & Layout
*   **Grid System:** Use grid or flexbox for neat content alignment.
*   **Spacing Scale:** Consistent padding and margin values (e.g., 8px, 16px, 24px).
*   **Layout Principles:** Divide content into cards or blocks with clear spacing to avoid clutter.

## Accessibility Requirements

#### Compliance Target
**Standard:** None specified for MVP beyond general web accessibility best practices.

#### Key Requirements
**Visual:**
- Color contrast ratios: Ensure sufficient contrast for readability (e.g., WCAG AA minimums for text).
- Focus indicators: Provide clear visual focus indicators for keyboard navigation.
- Text sizing: Allow browser-based text resizing without loss of content or functionality.

**Interaction:**
- Keyboard navigation: All interactive elements should be navigable and operable via keyboard.
- Screen reader support: Basic support for screen readers for core content and interactive elements.
- Touch targets: Ensure adequate touch target sizes for interactive elements on touch-enabled devices.

**Content:**
- Alternative text: Provide descriptive alt text for all meaningful images.
- Heading structure: Use semantic HTML heading tags (H1, H2, etc.) to define content hierarchy.
- Form labels: Associate all form inputs with descriptive labels.

#### Testing Strategy
*(To be defined later, likely manual testing for MVP.)*

## Responsiveness Strategy

#### Breakpoints
| Breakpoint | Min Width | Max Width | Target Devices      |
|------------|-----------|-----------|---------------------|
| Mobile     | 0px       | 639px     | Smartphones (portrait) |
| Tablet     | 640px     | 1023px    | Tablets (portrait/landscape), small laptops |
| Desktop    | 1024px    | 1279px    | Standard Desktops   |
| Wide       | 1280px    | -         | Large Monitors      |

#### Adaptation Patterns
**Layout Changes:**
- Content will reflow and stack vertically on smaller screens.
- Columns will collapse into single columns or adjust their width based on available space.
- Navigation elements may transform (e.g., from a horizontal bar to a hamburger menu on mobile).

**Navigation Changes:**
- Primary navigation will adapt to a mobile-friendly pattern (e.g., off-canvas menu, hamburger icon) on smaller screens.
- Secondary navigation may be hidden or presented in an accordion/tab format.

**Content Priority:**
- Essential content will remain prominent across all screen sizes.
- Less critical information or supplementary content may be hidden or accessible via expansion on smaller screens.

**Interaction Changes:**
- Touch-friendly interactions will be prioritized on mobile and tablet devices.
- Hover states may be removed or adapted for touch interfaces.

## Animation & Micro-interactions

#### Motion Principles
-   **Purposeful:** Animations should serve a clear purpose, guiding the user's attention, providing feedback, or enhancing understanding.
-   **Subtle:** Avoid overly distracting or gratuitous animations. They should be smooth and enhance the experience without being overwhelming.
-   **Consistent:** Apply motion principles consistently across the application for a predictable user experience.
-   **Performant:** Animations should run smoothly at 60fps (frames per second) to avoid jankiness.

#### Key Animations
-   **Button/Click Feedback:** Subtle visual feedback (e.g., slight scale, color change) on button clicks or interactive element taps.
-   **Form Validation:** Gentle animations for input field validation (e.g., a subtle shake for errors, a checkmark for success).
-   **Loading Indicators:** Smooth, non-distracting loading animations for content fetching or process execution.
-   **Agent Status Transitions:** Visual transitions when an agent's status changes (e.g., from "Idle" to "Active").
-   **Chat Message Entry:** New messages in the chat panel could subtly slide in or fade up.

## Performance Considerations

#### Performance Goals
-   **Page Load:** Aim for fast initial page load times (e.g., under 2-3 seconds on a typical broadband connection).
-   **Interaction Response:** User interactions (e.g., button clicks, form submissions) should feel instantaneous, with feedback provided within milliseconds.
-   **Workflow Visualization Updates:** Real-time updates for agent status and inter-agent communication should be near-instantaneous, minimizing perceived latency.

#### Design Strategies
-   **Lazy Loading:** Implement lazy loading for non-critical assets (e.g., images, components below the fold) to improve initial page load.
-   **Optimized Assets:** Use optimized images, fonts, and other media to reduce file sizes.
-   **Efficient UI Updates:** Design UI components to update efficiently, minimizing re-renders and DOM manipulations, especially for dynamic content like chat panels.
-   **Feedback Mechanisms:** Provide clear loading indicators and skeleton screens for asynchronous operations to manage user expectations.
-   **Minimize Network Requests:** Batch API calls where possible and leverage caching strategies.

## Next Steps
