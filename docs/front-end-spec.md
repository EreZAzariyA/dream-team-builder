    S[Knowledge Base] --> T[Generated Artifacts]
    S --> U[Workflow Templates]
    S --> V[Documentation]
    S --> W[Agent Guides]
```

### Navigation Structure

**Primary Navigation:** Hub-and-spoke architecture with Dashboard as central command center, providing contextual access to Workflows (BMAD orchestration), Agents (real-time collaboration), Integrations (external services), and Analytics (performance insights).

**Secondary Navigation:** Context-aware tabs that appear based on current activity - Workflow contexts show Progress/Chat/Artifacts, Agent contexts show Tasks/History/Settings, Admin contexts reveal Users/System/Billing sections.

**Breadcrumb Strategy:** Clear hierarchical paths for complex workflows (Dashboard → Workflows → [Name] → [Agent] → [Task]) with always-available quick escapes to parent contexts and Dashboard.

---

## User Flows

### Workflow Initiation Flow

**User Goal:** Start an AI-powered development workflow from initial idea to agent execution

**Entry Points:** Dashboard quick actions, chat interface workflow detection, template gallery, direct workflow creation

**Success Criteria:** User successfully initiates appropriate workflow with correct agent sequence within 3 clicks

#### Flow Diagram

    A[User Input/Idea] --> B[Smart Intent Detection]
    B --> C[Workflow Suggestions]
    C --> D[Template Selection]
    D --> E[Configuration Review]
    E --> F[Agent Sequence Confirmation]
    F --> G[Workflow Launch]
    G --> H[Real-time Monitoring]

    J --> K[Custom Sequence]
    K --> E
    
    C --> L[Chat-based Initiation]
    L --> M[Conversational Setup]
    M --> E
```

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:
- Incomplete project requirements → Guided requirement gathering
- Invalid agent combinations → Smart suggestions with explanations
- Resource availability conflicts → Queue management and scheduling options
- User permission restrictions → Clear messaging with escalation paths

**Notes:** Flow emphasizes progressive disclosure - simple start with option for advanced configuration. Multiple entry points accommodate different user preferences and contexts.

### Real-time Workflow Monitoring Flow

**User Goal:** Monitor active AI agent workflows with real-time visibility into progress, communications, and results

**Entry Points:** Dashboard active workflows, direct workflow URL, notification clicks, agent status updates

**Success Criteria:** User maintains clear understanding of workflow status and can intervene when needed

#### Flow Diagram

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Enter Monitoring View] --> B[Workflow Overview]
    B --> C[Agent Timeline Display]
    C --> D[Real-time Updates]
    D --> E[Communication Stream]

    L --> D
    
    J --> M[Pause/Resume/Cancel]
    M --> N[Confirmation Dialog]
    N --> O[Action Execution]
    O --> D
```

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:
- Agent communication failures → Clear error states with retry options
- Workflow timeout conditions → Automatic notifications with manual intervention choices
- Network disconnection → Offline state indication with reconnection handling
- Concurrent user modifications → Conflict resolution with merge strategies

**Notes:** Emphasizes transparency and control - users always understand current state and have intervention options without disrupting agent coordination.

**Standard:** WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance with enterprise-grade accessibility implementation

### Key Requirements

**Visual:**
- Color contrast ratios: 4.5:1 minimum for normal text, 3:1 for large text and UI components
- Focus indicators: 2px visible focus rings with 2px offset, using primary brand colors
- Text sizing: Minimum 16px for body text, scalable up to 200% without horizontal scrolling

**Interaction:**
- Keyboard navigation: Full keyboard accessibility for all interactive elements
- Screen reader support: Semantic HTML with proper ARIA labels and roles
- Touch targets: Minimum 44px touch targets with adequate spacing

**Content:**
- Alternative text: Descriptive alt text for all informative images and icons
- Heading structure: Logical H1-H6 hierarchy for proper document outline
- Form labels: Clear, descriptive labels associated with all form controls

### Testing Strategy

**Automated Testing:** Integration with axe-core for continuous accessibility validation
**Manual Testing:** Regular testing with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
**User Testing:** Accessibility testing with users who rely on assistive technologies

## Responsiveness Strategy

### Breakpoints

| Breakpoint | Min Width | Max Width | Target Devices |
|------------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| Mobile | 0px | 767px | Phones, small tablets |
| Tablet | 768px | 1023px | Tablets, small laptops |
| Desktop | 1024px | 1439px | Laptops, desktop monitors |
| Wide | 1440px | - | Large monitors, ultrawide displays |

### Adaptation Patterns

**Layout Changes:** Responsive grid systems that collapse gracefully from 3-column desktop to single-column mobile
**Navigation Changes:** Desktop sidebar navigation converts to mobile-optimized bottom navigation or hamburger menu
**Content Priority:** Progressive disclosure with most important workflow information prioritized on smaller screens
**Interaction Changes:** Touch-optimized interface elements with larger targets and gesture support

---

## Animation & Micro-interactions

### Motion Principles

Professional motion design that enhances usability without distraction:
- **Purposeful Animation:** Every animation serves a functional purpose
- **Consistent Timing:** 150ms for quick interactions, 300ms for standard transitions, 500ms for complex state changes
- **Accessible Motion:** Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` system settings
- **Performance Optimized:** GPU-accelerated animations using transform and opacity

### Key Animations

- **Agent Status Pulse:** 2s infinite pulse for active agents (Duration: 2000ms, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **Workflow Progress:** Smooth progress bar animation (Duration: 750ms, Easing: cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1))
- **Card Hover:** Subtle elevation and scale (Duration: 300ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Modal Entry:** Professional scale-in animation (Duration: 300ms, Easing: cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1))
- **Loading States:** Smooth skeleton loading (Duration: 1500ms, Easing: linear)
- **Success Feedback:** Professional bounce animation (Duration: 500ms, Easing: bounce)

---

## Performance Considerations

### Performance Goals

- **Page Load:** Initial page load under 3 seconds on 3G connections
- **Interaction Response:** UI interactions respond within 100ms
- **Animation FPS:** Maintain 60fps for all animations and transitions

### Design Strategies

**Optimized Asset Delivery:** Compressed images, optimized fonts, and efficient icon loading
**Progressive Enhancement:** Core functionality works without JavaScript, enhanced with interactive features
**Efficient Animations:** CSS transforms and opacity changes for optimal performance
**Smart Loading:** Skeleton screens and progressive image loading for perceived performance
