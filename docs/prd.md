5.  Given I am logged in, when I close and reopen the browser, then I should remain logged in (session persistence).

### Story 1.3: User Dashboard Access

As a logged-in user,
I want to access my personalized dashboard,
so that I can view an overview of my activities and access key features.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  Given I am successfully logged in, then I should be automatically redirected to my personalized user dashboard.
2.  Given I am on the user dashboard, then I should see a clear and intuitive layout providing an overview of my account.
3.  Given I am on the user dashboard, then I should be able to navigate to other sections of the application (e.g., settings, profile).
4.  Given I am on the user dashboard, when I refresh the page, then the dashboard content should load correctly and maintain my session.

### Story 1.4: Access Standard Information Pages

As a user (logged-in or not),
I want to access standard information pages like Privacy Policy and About,
so that I can understand the application's terms and purpose.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  Given I am on any page of the application, when I click on the "Privacy Policy" link, then I should be navigated to the Privacy Policy page.

## Epic 2 BMAD Agent Integration

### Story 2.1: Initiate BMAD Workflow via User Prompt

As a user,
I want to enter text into a prompt and submit it,
so that the BMAD-METHOD workflow is automatically initiated and agents begin executing sequentially.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  Given I am on the home page, when I enter text into the main input prompt and submit it, then the BMAD-METHOD workflow should begin.
2.  Given the workflow has started, then the system should internally activate the first agent in the predefined BMAD-METHOD sequence.
3.  Given an agent is executing, then the system should automatically pass control to the next agent in the sequence upon completion of the current agent's task, without requiring further user input.
4.  Given the workflow is initiated, then the system should prepare to display the progress of the agents' automated execution (as per Epic 3).

### Story 2.2: Load and Manage BMAD Agent Definitions

As a system,
I want to correctly load and manage the definitions of BMAD agents and their dependencies,
so that agents can execute their tasks and workflows as intended.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  Given the BMAD-METHOD workflow is initiated, then the system should be able to access and parse the YAML definitions for all agents involved in the workflow (e.g., from `.bmad-core/agents/`).
2.  Given an agent is activated within the workflow, then the system should correctly load any required dependencies (tasks, templates, checklists, data) specified in that agent's definition.
3.  Given an agent attempts to execute a command or task, then the system should ensure that the necessary resources (e.g., task files, templates) are available and correctly referenced.
4.  Given an agent's definition specifies `activation-instructions` or `core_principles`, then the system should internally adhere to these rules during the agent's execution.

## Epic 3 Automated Agent Workflow Visualization

### Story 3.1: Visualize Active Agent and Inter-Agent Communication

As a user,
I want to visually track the active BMAD agent and see the communication between agents,
so that I can understand the workflow's progress and internal operations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  Given the BMAD workflow is running, when an agent becomes active, then its visual representation (e.g., card, icon) should display a highlighted border color.
2.  Given the BMAD workflow is running, when an agent becomes active, then its status indicator should change to "Active".
3.  Given an agent has completed its task within the workflow, then its status indicator should revert to "Idle".
4.  Given the BMAD workflow is running, then all messages exchanged between agents (e.g., agent A passing output to agent B, agent B requesting input from agent C) should be displayed in a dedicated chat panel or log.
5.  Given messages are displayed in the chat panel, then they should clearly indicate which agents are communicating.

### Story 3.2: Display Overall Workflow Status and Progress

As a user,
I want to see the overall status of the BMAD workflow and which step is currently being executed,
so that I can understand the high-level progress of the automated process.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  Given the BMAD workflow is initiated, then a clear indicator of the overall workflow status (e.g., "Running", "Paused", "Completed", "Error") should be displayed.
2.  Given the workflow is running, then the current step or phase of the workflow should be clearly indicated (e.g., "Analyst Phase", "PM Phase", "Executing Task X").
3.  Given the workflow progresses from one step to the next, then the displayed current step should update automatically.
4.  Given the workflow completes successfully, then the overall status should change to "Completed".
5.  Given an error occurs during the workflow, then the overall status should change to "Error", and a brief error message should be displayed.

### Story 3.3: Display Agent-Generated Output/Artifacts

As a user,
I want to see the documents, code, or other artifacts generated by the BMAD agents during the workflow,
so that I can review the tangible results of the automated process.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  Given an agent completes a task that generates a document (e.g., PRD, story file), then the generated document should be displayed or linked in a dedicated output panel.
2.  Given an agent generates code or configuration files, then these files should be displayed in a readable format (e.g., code editor with syntax highlighting) or linked for download.
3.  Given an agent produces a log or report (e.g., checklist results), then this output should be displayed in a clear and organized manner.
4.  Given multiple outputs are generated during a workflow, then they should be organized chronologically or by agent, allowing for easy review.
5.  Given an output is a file, then there should be an option to download or view the file in its native format.
