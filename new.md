    "title": "Potential for Large and Complex API Route Files",
    "description": "The file `app/api/chat/route.ts` is likely a central component for handling AI chat interactions. In AI-driven applications, such files can quickly grow in size and complexity, incorporating logic for prompt engineering, external API calls, data processing, and response generation. Without clear separation of concerns, this can lead to reduced readability, increased cognitive load for developers, and higher risk of introducing bugs during modifications. Managing a large file makes it harder to test individual units of logic effectively.",
    "suggestion": "Refactor `app/api/chat/route.ts` by extracting distinct responsibilities into smaller, focused modules or utility functions. For example, separate prompt generation, external service calls (if any directly within this route), and response formatting into their own files. Implement a clear dependency injection pattern if complex services are involved to improve testability and modularity.",

    "title": "Inconsistent Error Handling and Logging",
    "description": "Across the TypeScript files, there may be inconsistencies in how errors are caught, handled, and logged. A lack of standardized error handling can make debugging challenging, obscure critical issues in production, and lead to a poor user experience. Without a unified logging strategy, it's difficult to monitor application health, track down the root cause of failures, or gather sufficient information for post-mortem analysis, especially in a system integrating external services like Google Calendar and GitHub.",
    "suggestion": "Establish a consistent error handling strategy across the application. Use a centralized error handling middleware for API routes and a robust logging library (e.g., Winston or Pino) for detailed error reporting. Standardize error objects to include relevant context like timestamps, request IDs, and stack traces. Ensure errors are caught at appropriate boundaries and logged with severity levels.",

    "severity": "high",
    "title": "Absence of Dedicated Test Files and Framework",
    "description": "A review of the top files does not indicate the presence of dedicated test files (e.g., `.test.ts`, `.spec.ts`) or the usage of a testing framework. This suggests a significant lack of automated unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. Without a comprehensive test suite, changes to the codebase carry a high risk of regressions, new features may introduce unexpected side effects, and refactoring efforts become perilous. This directly impacts the reliability and maintainability of the application.",
    "suggestion": "Introduce a testing framework such as Jest or React Testing Library (for components) and set up a basic test suite. Start by writing unit tests for critical utility functions in `lib/` and integration tests for API routes like `app/api/chat/route.ts` and `app/api/github/code/route.ts`. Integrate testing into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure tests run automatically on every code change.",

    "title": "Missing Component-Level Testing for UI Elements",
    "description": "Key UI components like `app/components/Chat.tsx` and `app/components/CodeShowcaseEnhanced.tsx` are crucial for user interaction. Without component-level tests, the functionality, rendering, and interaction logic of these components are not verified automatically. This can lead to visual bugs, broken user flows, and unexpected behavior that might only be caught during manual testing, slowing down the development cycle and increasing the likelihood of deploying faulty UI.",
    "suggestion": "Implement component-level testing using a framework like React Testing Library or Enzyme. Focus on testing component rendering, user interactions (e.g., button clicks, input changes), and prop handling for `app/components/Chat.tsx` and `app/components/CodeShowcaseEnhanced.tsx`. Mock external dependencies or context providers to isolate component behavior for reliable testing.",

    "title": "Potential for Unvalidated API Inputs",
    "description": "API endpoints such as `app/api/chat/route.ts` and `app/api/github/code/route.ts` are entry points for external data. If these endpoints lack robust input validation, the application becomes vulnerable to various attacks, including injection (e.g., SQL, NoSQL, command), cross-site scripting (XSS), and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks through malformed or oversized payloads. Unvalidated inputs can also lead to application crashes or data corruption.",
    "suggestion": "Implement comprehensive input validation for all API routes using a schema validation library like Zod or Joi. Define strict schemas for expected request bodies, query parameters, and headers, ensuring data types, formats, and constraints are enforced before processing. Return clear error messages for invalid inputs to guide API consumers.",

    "title": "Risk of Hardcoded Sensitive Information",
    "description": "Given the integration with external services like Google Calendar and GitHub (via `lib/google-calendar.ts`, `lib/mcp-github.ts`), there is a significant risk that API keys, authentication tokens, or other sensitive credentials might be hardcoded directly within the source files. Hardcoding secrets makes them easily discoverable, especially if the repository is public, leading to unauthorized access, service abuse, and severe security breaches. This is a critical vulnerability that must be addressed immediately.",
    "suggestion": "Migrate all sensitive credentials, API keys, and tokens to environment variables. Utilize a `.env` file for local development and a secure secret management service (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Google Secret Manager, or Kubernetes Secrets) for production deployments. Ensure `.env` files are explicitly excluded from version control using `.gitignore`.",

    "title": "Potential API Latency from External Service Calls",
    "description": "The application integrates with external services like Google Calendar and GitHub, as indicated by `lib/google-calendar.ts` and `lib/mcp-github.ts`. API calls to these external services can introduce significant latency, especially if network conditions are poor or the external service itself is experiencing high load. If these calls are made synchronously within critical user flows or frequently accessed API routes (e.g., `app/api/chat/route.ts`), they can degrade overall application performance and user experience, leading to slow response times.",
    "suggestion": "Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data from external services where appropriate. Consider asynchronous processing or background jobs for non-critical external API interactions to avoid blocking the main request thread. Implement timeouts and retry mechanisms for external calls to improve resilience and provide graceful degradation. Profile API routes to identify specific bottlenecks caused by external service latency.",

A `README.md` is essential for providing a clear overview, setup instructions, and usage guidelines for new contributors or users, significantly impacting onboarding. A `LICENSE` file is vital for defining the legal terms under which the project can be used, distributed, and modified, preventing legal ambiguities and promoting open-source collaboration.",
    "suggestion": "Create a comprehensive `README.md` that includes a project description, installation instructions, development setup, and contribution guidelines. Add a `LICENSE` file, choosing an appropriate open-source license (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0) to clarify usage rights and obligations for the project.

However, `new.md` might indicate ad-hoc or unorganized documentation that could become outdated or difficult to navigate as the project grows. Inconsistent documentation structure makes it harder for developers to find relevant information, leading to knowledge silos and increased ramp-up time for new team members.",
    "suggestion": "Establish a clear documentation strategy and structure. Consolidate `new.md` content into more appropriate, structured documentation sections. Consider using a documentation generator or a dedicated `docs/` folder with clear categories (e.g., `setup`, `api-reference`, `troubleshooting`).

    "description": "Components like `app/components/Chat.tsx` and `app/components/CodeShowcaseEnhanced.tsx` might be directly interacting with API logic or managing complex state that should ideally reside in a more centralized or decoupled store. Tight coupling between UI components and business logic or data fetching mechanisms can make components harder to reuse, test in isolation, and maintain. Changes in the API or data structure could necessitate widespread modifications across multiple UI components.",        
    "suggestion": "Adopt a clear separation of concerns by introducing a state management library (e.g., Zustand, Jotai, or React Context API for simpler cases) to manage global or shared application state. Extract data fetching logic into custom hooks or dedicated service modules, allowing components to focus solely on rendering and user interaction. This
