# Agent Teams Component

## Overview

The Agent Teams system is a core component of the BMAD (Business Methodology for Autonomous Development) platform that provides pre-configured bundles of specialized AI agents designed for different development scenarios. Each team includes specific agents and workflows optimized for particular use cases, enabling efficient orchestration of multi-agent development workflows.

### Data Flow

1. **Configuration Loading**: Teams are defined in `.bmad-core/agent-teams/*.yaml` files
2. **API Layer**: `/api/agent-teams` route reads and parses YAML configurations
3. **Frontend Display**: React components render team data with styling from `agentHelpers.js`
4. **Deployment**: Teams can be deployed for workflow execution (future implementation)

## Agent Teams Configuration

### Team Definition Structure (YAML)

```yaml
bundle:
  name: "Team Name"
  icon: "ðŸš€"
  description: "Description of what this team does"
agents:
  - bmad-orchestrator
  - analyst
  - pm
  - architect
  - dev
workflows:
  - greenfield-fullstack.yaml
  - brownfield-service.yaml
```

## Core Agents

### Planning & Analysis Agents
- **analyst** (Mary, ðŸ“Š): Market research, brainstorming, competitive analysis, project briefing
- **pm** (Project Manager): PRD creation, feature prioritization, strategic planning
- **architect** (System Architect): Technical architecture, system design, scalability planning

### Design & User Experience
- **ux-expert** (UX Designer): UI/UX design, prototypes, user experience optimization

### Development & Quality
- **dev** (Developer): Code implementation, debugging, feature development
- **qa** (QA Engineer): Test planning, quality assurance, bug validation

### Coordination & Management
- **po** (Product Owner): Backlog management, story validation, acceptance criteria
- **sm** (Scrum Master): Sprint planning, story creation, workflow management
- **bmad-orchestrator** (Orchestrator): Multi-agent coordination, workflow orchestration

## Workflow Integration

### Phase 1: Planning (Web UI)
Teams are used in web interfaces (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) where large context windows enable:
- Comprehensive document generation (PRDs, Architecture specs)
- Multi-agent brainstorming and collaboration
- Strategic planning and requirement gathering

### Phase 2: Development (IDE)
Teams transition to IDE environments for:
- Document sharding and story creation
- Sequential SM â†’ Dev â†’ QA cycles
- Real-time implementation and testing

### Workflow Types

1. **Greenfield Workflows**: Building new projects from scratch
   - `greenfield-fullstack.yaml`: Complete application development
   - `greenfield-service.yaml`: New service/API development
   - `greenfield-ui.yaml`: Frontend-only projects

2. **Brownfield Workflows**: Enhancing existing projects
   - `brownfield-fullstack.yaml`: Adding features to existing apps
   - `brownfield-service.yaml`: Extending existing services
   - `brownfield-ui.yaml`: UI improvements and additions

## Component Implementation

### Current Implementation (`app/(dashboard)/agent-teams/page.js`)

The current monolithic component (205 lines) handles:
- Team configuration loading via API
- Grid layout display of team cards
- Agent list rendering within teams
- Workflow display and formatting
- Comparison table generation
- Error handling and loading states

### Planned Refactoring

Following the "small components" approach, the component should be broken down into:

#### 1. Container Components
- **AgentTeamsPage.js**: Main page container, data fetching, error handling
- **TeamGrid.js**: Grid layout manager for team cards

#### 2. Display Components  
- **TeamCard.js**: Individual team card with styling and interactions
- **AgentList.js**: Agent display within team cards
- **WorkflowList.js**: Workflow display and formatting
- **TeamComparison.js**: Comparison table component

#### 3. Utility Components
- **LoadingState.js**: Loading indicator with spinner
- **ErrorState.js**: Error display with retry options

#### 4. Custom Hooks
- **useAgentTeams.js**: Team data fetching with React Query (already exists)
- **useTeamDeployment.js**: Team deployment logic (future)

## API Integration

### Endpoint: `/api/agent-teams`

```javascript
GET /api/agent-teams
```

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "team-fullstack",
      "fileName": "team-fullstack.yaml",
      "name": "Team Fullstack",
      "icon": "ðŸš€",
      "description": "Team capable of full stack development",
      "agents": ["bmad-orchestrator", "analyst", "pm", "ux-expert", "architect", "po"],
      "workflows": ["brownfield-fullstack.yaml", "greenfield-fullstack.yaml"]
    }
  ],
  "count": 4
}
```

### Error Handling

The API handles:
- Missing `.bmad-core/agent-teams` directory
- Invalid YAML file parsing
- File system access errors
- Graceful degradation when individual files fail to parse

## Styling System

### Agent Styling (`lib/utils/agentHelpers.js`)

Each agent has consistent color theming:
- **pm**: Purple theme (`text-purple-600`, `bg-purple-50`)
- **architect**: Cyan theme (`text-cyan-600`, `bg-cyan-50`)
- **dev**: Green theme (`text-green-600`, `bg-green-50`)
- **qa**: Orange theme (`text-orange-600`, `bg-orange-50`)

### Team Styling

Teams have distinct visual identities:
- **team-all**: Blue theme with ðŸ‘¥ emoji
- **team-fullstack**: Purple theme with ðŸš€ emoji  
- **team-ide-minimal**: Green theme with âš¡ emoji
- **team-no-ui**: Orange theme with ðŸ”§ emoji

## Usage Patterns

### 1. Team Selection
Users browse available teams based on:
- Project type (greenfield vs brownfield)
- Scope (fullstack, backend-only, minimal)
- Team size preferences
- Workflow complexity needs

### 2. Team Deployment
Teams are deployed to initiate workflows:
- Configuration validation
- Agent instantiation
- Workflow template loading
- Real-time collaboration setup

### 3. Workflow Execution
Once deployed, teams execute structured workflows:
- Sequential agent handoffs
- Document generation and validation
- Story creation and implementation
- Quality assurance and review cycles

## Development Considerations

### Performance
- Team configurations are cached via React Query (30-minute stale time)
- YAML parsing happens server-side to reduce client bundle size
- Error boundaries prevent team loading failures from breaking the entire interface

### Extensibility
- New teams can be added by creating YAML files in `.bmad-core/agent-teams/`
- Custom agents can be integrated through the agent system
- Workflows can be mixed and matched across teams

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for team deployment workflows
- Mock data for consistent testing

## Future Enhancements

### Team Customization
- Custom team builder interface
- Agent role modification
- Workflow sequence customization
- Team templates and presets

### Advanced Features
- Team performance analytics
- Workflow success metrics
- Agent utilization tracking
- Cost optimization insights

### Integration Improvements
- IDE-specific team configurations
- Git workflow integration
- Slack/Teams notifications
- Project management tool synchronization

## Best Practices

### Configuration Management
- Use semantic team names that clearly indicate purpose
- Maintain consistent YAML structure across team files
- Document team capabilities and limitations
- Version control team configurations

### UI/UX Guidelines
- Provide clear visual distinction between team types
- Show agent count and workflow count prominently
- Enable easy comparison between teams
- Offer helpful descriptions and use case guidance

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when teams fail to load
- Clear error messages for configuration issues
- Fallback options when preferred teams are unavailable
- Retry mechanisms for transient failures
